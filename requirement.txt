**Agent Prompt: Build an Offline‑First PPL Workout App**

1. **Project Setup & Tech Stack**

   * Use a cross‑platform framework (e.g. React Native or Flutter).
   * Use a light, on‑device relational DB (e.g. SQLite or Realm).
   * No cloud services—everything lives on the device.
   * Include only essential native modules: filesystem, local notifications, geolocation, background tasks/timers.

2. **Data Model & Persistence**

   * **WorkoutDay**

     * `id` (PK, auto‑inc)
     * `date` (ISO YYYY‑MM‑DD)
   * **Exercise**

     * `id` (PK)
     * `name` (string)
     * `isCompound` (bool)
   * **WorkoutEntry** (links Day ⇆ Exercise)

     * `id` (PK)
     * `day_id` (FK → WorkoutDay.id)
     * `exercise_id` (FK → Exercise.id)
     * `sets` (int)
     * `reps` (int)
   * On first launch, prepopulate the DB with your 6‑day PPL template.
   * Data cleanup: Schedule a background job that deletes any `WorkoutDay` rows older than 30 days.

3. **Core Screens & Flows**

   1. **Daily View**

      * Shows today’s date and list of `WorkoutEntry` for that day.
      * Each entry displays exercise name + “3 × 8–12 reps” (or whatever sets/reps).
   2. **Exercise Detail/Edit**

      * Tap an entry to adjust sets/reps or mark complete.
   3. **History / Calendar**

      * Swipe back/forward to see past or future days (with data or placeholders).
   4. **Settings**

      * Toggle “Location‑based reminders” ON/OFF.
      * Manage saved “Gym location” pins.
      * Show “Last DB cleanup” timestamp.

4. **Location‑Based Notifications**

   * On first use of reminders, request **Location Always** and **Notifications** permissions.
   * Let user **pin** one or more gym locations (lat/lng).
   * When the device enters a pinned location during your usual workout time window (configurable, e.g. 5 pm–8 pm), fire a **local notification**: “Time for today’s push workout!”
   * Use geofencing APIs (Android GeofencingClient / iOS CLLocationManager).

5. **Background Tasks**

   * **Daily Reset**: At midnight, load the next day’s `WorkoutEntry` into view.
   * **Monthly Cleanup**: Once every 30 days run a background job (WorkManager / Headless JS / BackgroundFetch) that purges DB rows older than 30 days.

6. **Memory & Storage Management**

   * Keep in‑memory state minimal—load only today’s entries at launch.
   * Close DB connections when idle.
   * Clear any cached images or temp files older than 30 days in the same monthly cleanup job.

7. **Permissions & Privacy**

   * Clearly explain why you need location & notifications in the Settings screen.
   * All data remains on device—no syncing.
   * Provide a “Clear all data” button under Settings.

8. **Error Handling & UX**

   * Show friendly alerts for DB errors, permission denials, or geofence failures.
   * If location permissions are denied, disable reminders and grey out the toggle.
   * Provide offline‑ready skeleton screens (no spinners waiting on network).

9. **Testing & QA**

   * Write unit tests for DB CRUD operations, data‑purge logic, and notification scheduling.
   * Use integration tests or end‑to‑end (e.g. Detox / Flutter Driver) to cover:

     * Day‑to‑day navigation
     * Editing sets/reps
     * Geofence entry → notification
     * Monthly cleanup (simulate date jump)

10. **Deliverables**

    * A runnable app bundle (APK + IPA) that installs cleanly on device.
    * README with setup steps, platform‑specific notes (Android vs iOS), and testing instructions.
    * Post‑install walkthrough screen to guide the user through permissions and gym‑location pinning.
